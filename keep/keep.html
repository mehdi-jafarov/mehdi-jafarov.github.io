      <h2>How the Model Works</h2>
      <p>
        The deployed model uses historical SBA loan data to predict loan approvals. For this demo, we intentionally limited input features to highlight key patterns. Among these, industry type strongly influences defaults, so we engineered a binary feature: "Real Estate Company?" Businesses are classified as real estate or non-real estate, reflecting historical trends where real-estate-backed loans carry lower default risk.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      This interactive demo is part of the larger SBA Loan Default Prediction project, which explores how machine learning can forecast loan defaults. Inspired by the article "Should This Loan Be Approved or Denied?", the project demonstrates end-to-end development:
